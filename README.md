# ict-solutions ðŸŽ“
solutions for tasks on different platforms ([here](https://informatics.msk.ru) for example)
PS: some solutions for dynamic programming can be found [here](https://github.com/eliseydudin/dp-school)

# running
to run the programs you are going to need:
1. a c/c++ compiler (like `gcc` or `clang`)
2. meson
3. a python 3.x interpreter

to run a solution use the `run.py` utility from the root of the repo, example:
```bash
./run.py inf 160
```
this will automatically compile all files & execute the program at `./informatics/160.cpp`.

# contributing
any contributions are welcome! provide any solutions for any website with programming tasks, the only requirement is that they pass _some_ tests
