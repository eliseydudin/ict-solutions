1. a calculator can perform two tasks: increment the number by 2, multiply it by 3. how many programs are there, which given the input 1 output the number 55? [solution](1/main.go). answer: 32
2. a calculator can perform two tasks: increment the number by 1, multiply it by 1.5 if it's even. how many programs are there, which given the input 1 output the number 20? [solution](2/main.go). answer: 32
3. a calculator can perform three tasks: increment the number by 1, increment by 3 and square the number. how many programs are there, which given the input 3 output 26, and their trajectory doesn't contain the number 16 but contains the number 20? [solution](3/main.go). answer: 936
4. a calculator can perform three tasks: subtract 3, subtract 1, divide by 2 (div). how many programs are there, which given the input 39 output 7, and their trajectory contain the numbers 19 and 16? [solution](4/main.go). answer: 56320
5. task [6274](../solution_6274/src/main.rs). answer: 86 (or 85 iirc)
